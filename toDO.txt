1.Add proper citation in question 1.
2. Switch from geom_point to linear in the suicide overview.
3. Explain commands after transforming. In a text under the code. Before the code the intention is mentioned. But not for visualisation. In Visualisation the legend will do the job.
4. Add legend to ggplot.
5. Countries with highest suicide rate in one overview. This is quite tricky I know how to do this. Just ask for help or a hint.
I have to switch from overall cases to population related ones. I will do that right now. You can start with everything expect 1 after I did this. Idk now what changes I need to make. I will do this during this night. So tomorrow morning this is ready.
